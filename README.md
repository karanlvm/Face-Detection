# Face Detection
 
Face recognition has many challenges due to illumination variations, large dimensionality, uncontrolled environments, aging, and pose variations. In recent years, Face recognition get remarkable improvement and accuracy to overcome these challenges. The issue of face detection can be resolved in several ways. I have implemented the same using Dlib and MediaPipe.
